Cloud Computing & Free Tier Research

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet instead of using local machines. It allows users to access resources on demand, pay only for what they use, and scale services easily. Cloud platforms reduce hardware costs and increase flexibility. Users can deploy applications globally without managing physical infrastructure.
